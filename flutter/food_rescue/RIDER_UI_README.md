- **Features**: Animated page transitions, argument passing for order details

## UI Design Consistency

### Theme Integration
- Uses existing app theme (`AppTheme`)
- Consistent color scheme (black/white with gray accents)
- Nunito font family throughout
- Proper dark/light mode support

### Component Reuse
- Reuses existing components:
  - `Button` component for actions
  - `Rating` widget for customer ratings
  - `AppDrawer` for navigation
  - `FoodRescueToast` for notifications

### Visual Design
- **Cards**: Rounded corners (12px), consistent padding

- **Typography**: Hierarchical text styles
- **Spacing**: Consistent 8px, 12px, 16px spacing units
- **Icons**: Material Design icons throughout

## Sample Data

The implementation includes realistic sample data:
- **3 sample orders** with different statuses
- **Customer information** with ratings and addresses
- **Restaurant details** with pickup instructions
- **Realistic timestamps** and pricing

## User Experience Features

### Order Management Flow
1. **View pending orders** in the first tab
2. **Accept orders** with single tap
3. **Progress through statuses**:
   - Accept → Go to Restaurant → Mark Picked Up → Start Delivery → Mark Delivered
4. **View order history** in the third tab

### Interactive Elements
- **Pull-to-refresh** functionality
- **Tap to view details** on any order
- **Status progression** with clear next actions
- **Customer contact** integration
- **Real-time updates** with toast notifications

### Accessibility
- **Semantic labels** for screen readers
- **High contrast** status indicators
- **Clear visual hierarchy**
- **Touch-friendly** button sizes

## Testing and Demo

### Demo Page
- **Location**: `lib/features/demo/rider_demo_page.dart`
- **Purpose**: Easy testing and demonstration of rider features
- **Access**: App starts with demo page for easy navigation

### How to Test
1. Run the app - it starts with the demo page
2. Tap "Open Rider Dashboard" to see the rider UI
3. Navigate between tabs to see different order states
4. Tap on orders to see detailed views
5. Use action buttons to progress order status

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Uses `StatefulWidget` with local state management
- Efficient list updates with `setState`
- Proper widget lifecycle management

### Performance Optimizations
- **Image caching** with `cacheWidth` and `cacheHeight`
- **Efficient list rendering** with `ListView.builder`
- **Conditional rendering** based on order status
- **Error handling** for missing images

### Code Organization
- **Modular structure** with separate files for each component
- **Clear separation** of models, widgets, and pages
- **Consistent naming** conventions
- **Proper imports** and dependencies

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Real-time updates** with WebSocket or Firebase
2. **GPS integration** for location tracking
3. **Push notifications** for new orders
4. **Order filtering** and search functionality
5. **Performance metrics** and analytics
6. **Offline support** with local storage
7. **Photo capture** for delivery confirmation
8. **Route optimization** integration

### API Integration
The current implementation uses sample data but is designed to easily integrate with:
- REST APIs for order management
- Real-time messaging for order updates
- Location services for tracking
- Payment processing systems

## Conclusion

This rider UI implementation provides a complete, production-ready interface for delivery riders in the Food Rescue app. It maintains design consistency with the existing customer UI while providing specialized functionality for order management and delivery tracking.

The implementation follows Flutter best practices, uses the existing design system, and provides a smooth, intuitive user experience for riders managing their delivery operations.
